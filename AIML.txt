Machine Learning : 

Learn 
ML Life cycle : 
--> Algorithums 


1. What is meachine Learning 
-> It is all about learning form data without  being explicate programming 



Tradition programming : 

Data + program   ------> Output 

ML 
-->   Data + IN/OT ---> Program (Algorithum)


program 
add two numbers :  it only perform addition of two numbers : 

ML 
it understand it is addition logic :: 
now you can add multiple values not ony two

You cannot program  for every case (condition) 
to check every case it's not possible : ðŸ˜…

ml --> learning form data 
as data is changing logic is also changes 

where ml is used where you not able to write case for each condition state 
eg : image classification 

WAP -->  to ideantify this is dog or not  
-- write native cases ---- hard 
ml ---> easy data processing 


Data mining : 
--> ML base 

HIstory of ML 
-> ml is long in industry

Data is important for ML 
data access is easy now then before  that's wise ML is now boom


------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
what is Inteligence :
-> pattern recognation

we can't write all condition to build expert system to build dog image classification , voice  --- not application symbolic AI 


ML  - > you not do explicate programming for all condition 
provide data as input and rules will generate automatically 
dont write rules ( program )
-> provide input  as features (properties)

DP (deep learning) 
-> it is ml 
-> mathmatical logic 
-> inspire by our biologically 
-> it is used on big data 


AI
->ML
-->DP
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Type of Machine Learning : 

1.Superwise
2.Unsuperwise
3.SemiSuperwise
4.Reinforcement

1.Superwise  In + OP ----->  draw relationship between IN & OP  
-> you have both input and output so on the base of that you predicte output for new input on the base of data 

--->regression
---> classification

data__
    numerical data 
    categorical data   

____ prediction____
-regression  
-->output column is numrical

classification
--> ouput column is categorical 

2.Unsuperwise
--> we have only input data 
--> here it is not take place of prediction you got a point
___________________
-clustering 
--> plot data in 2 axios 
--> lable data creation (making group of same properties)


-dimensionallity reduction 
--> many input column 
--> combine multiple column to make single column (reduce dim)
 


-anomally reduction 
--> something unexpeactage not average case 


-association rule learning 
--> arranging things in proper manner which create more profit


3.SemiSuperwise
--> google photos:making group of same photos ( clustering )

4.Reinforcement
Eg self driving cars
--> we don't have data 
--> Learn from mistakes  



------------------------------------
What about Aptitude ........
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type of ML
-> it base on how train your model 
Batch vs online learning ____

ENV
-> development 
->production 


Batch Learning / offline 
-> data not change frequently 
-> train on all data at same time 
-> on production it only gives prediction not learn this model ok 

Disadvantage:
-> Lots of Data 
-> Hardware Limitation
-> Availability

Online Learning :
-> improve performnance as user used this product more 
-> -> on production it only gives prediction and also learn form new input data as well 
-> train model dynamically on server 
-> fast training ---> fast solution 
Eg : YouTube 

sklearn -->  support batch learning  / offline learning 
River library : - ML on streaming data 
vowpal wabbit 

-Learning Rate : 


-Out of Core Learning :    
training data offline with online learning way 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How ML learn 
learning 
-> memorizing --->  Instance base learning 
-> understanding concept ----> model base learning 


Instance Base Learning :
-> according to your surrounding : KNN algorithum  
-> no training & learning 
-> storage heavy
-> lazy learning 

Model Base Learning : 
-> It create one mathamatical function 
-> it create mathamatical relationship between input and OT
-> classification ML
-> storage is less    
Eg : Leanior 


What you understand 
In future you should albe to classify which type of algorithum is as like you gotm y point eg : model base learning or instance base learning : 



# Challenges in ML 

1.Data Collection
2. Insufficient Data 
3. Non Representative Data
4. Poor Quality Data 
5. Irrelevant data 
6. Overfitting
7. Underfitting
8. Software Integration
9. Offline Learning / Deployment
10.Cost Involved 

- Data Collection 
approchs 
-> API 
-> Web scraping 

If quality of data is poor then result are also poor ok  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application of Machine Learning : 

-> in B2B business examples 
1. Retail - Amazon/ Big Bazaar
2. Transportation  -QLA
3. Manufacturing - Tesla 


Sentimental analysis 

If you are not paying for the products then you are Product__
-> your data will be sold for money :
-> 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Machine Learning Life Cycle :(MLDLC)
<--- Set of guide lines whiling developing ml products --->
1. Frame the Problem
2. Gathering Data 
-> API | web scraping | 
3. Data Preprocessing 
-> Remove duplicate
-> remove missing values
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Feature Engineering and Selection
6. Model Training, Evalation and Selection
7. Model Deployment
8. Testing
9. Optimize

AngelList : for Job Role Internships : 

1. Data Engineer 
-> collecting data in effective and efficient way: 
-> Database  --make-> Data ware house  

2. Data Analyst
-> good knowledge of Statistical programming 
-> have common sence 
-> Data Story Telling 

3. Data Scientist :
___> Full Stack Role --> 
--> creating best model 
->A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than
--any software engineer and  at software engineering than any statistician  


4. ML Engineer : 


How to develop Common sence 
in ML how many types of algorithum are present 



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am building Vide Coding same as like our Code minder just I am change the name of it in that what we provided to user is that user can able to see their progress at one place they can track their profile  
as like github , leetcode they can able to see their all progress and activities in visual form 
Question tracker in that user can able to track their questions which they solve and which are remaining and added notes to that particular question as well 
and another one is Event Tracker in that user get all Event information which is upcoming so it never be miss out form ant one 
and addition what we added in that is like AI Resume analysis it not only told you about your resume your weak and strong points but also gives you real time job opportunities by scraping job info form different websites you got my point now we only scrap Internshala  jobs data 
in future we can scrap another websites data as well 
AI Mock Interview Taker in that what happen is that user can create according given job role and description and exp level it will create personalize Mock Interview you know that very well we build this form scratch 
and one of the important session is community in that we goanna create groups and as according to user requirement and interest they can join their related groups and enjoying learning 

and at last we have all data of user so on the base of that we create one AI Guide which know all your information so what happen is that it gives you personalize responsive not general as like chat gpt you got my point 

I am presenting this idea in one of the shark tank  competition but you know that 
it is quite similar as Codolio  website if you know very well about that is this great idea to pitch 

In that I am notice one thing which is data 
we can used user data in effective way to give them personalize advice and user that data to show that only particular adds to user 
we can used data to get impact full result as like we track user behavior ok and on that base of that 
we recomanded user cources and other things according to their own self 
you got my point I think this was my main revenue point I think 
and we can make money form this as well 
you know that as well 
if user not pay for product then they are product 

what your thought on this don't give me general advice we goanna think as startup found and we can win competition as like you got my point 
we discuss lots of things about it ok 
if you have any question then ask me so due to that you get better clarity of taught ok 
is this really impact full or good ?
